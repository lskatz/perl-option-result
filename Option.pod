       Option::Option

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       Provides objects that can hold results that can be unwrapped similar to
       Rust

           use Option::Option;

           my $option = Option::Option->new("something");

           # This croaks:
           print $var;

           # This works
           my $var = $option->unwrap();
           print $var;

           # This also works and has a helpful error message
           my $var = $option->expect("get my something");
           print $var;

       [4mnew()[0m
           Creates a new object with a variable

       [4munwrap()[0m
           Checks if the variable is defined and if it is, returns it.  If not
           defined, croaks.

       expect($msg)
           Checks if the variable is defined and if it is, returns it.  If not
           defined, croaks with error message.

       [4mtoString()[0m
           Dies with an error message, describing that the object was
           attempted to be used in a scalar context without unwrapping.  This
           subroutine is not meant to be used directly.

               my $var = Option::Option->new("something");
               my $concat = $var . " wicked this way comes";
               # dies with error message during the concatenation
